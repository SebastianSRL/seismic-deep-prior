# Seismic Source Recovery Algorithm via Internal Learning in the Cross-spread Domain: A Tensorflow Implementation
This is a Tensorflow implementation of the proposed work in ["Seismic Source Recovery Algorithm via Internal Learning in the Cross-spread Domain"]([https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9592023](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TWFD08sAAAAJ&citation_for_view=TWFD08sAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC)) (Sebastián Rivera, Iván Ortíz, Tatiana Gelvez, Laura Galvis, Henry Arguello, EAGE, 2022).

## Usage 

To avoid Tensorflow and CUDA compatibility issues, we employ and recommend Docker.
After installing Docker, execute the following command in the project's root folder:

```bash
docker-compose up 
```
## Results
The image below illustrates a comparison between the reconstructed shots obtained using the proposed method and those generated by other reconstruction techniques. 
The top-right corner displays the PSNR metric.
